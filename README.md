## Description

I initially wrote this program for a homework assignment in a computer organization and Assembly language course taught by [Dr. Mahmut Unan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmutunan/) at [UAB](https://www.uab.edu/), and then I polished it.

This program is an interactive binary search program written in `x86_64` AT&T Assembly that allows the user to create a sorted array of integers and search for an element inside it.

## Instructions

### To Compile

Use any of the following commands:

- `make`
- `gcc -Wall -no-pie -o binary_search binary_search.s` (for GCC 9 or newer)
- `gcc -Wall -o binary_search binary_search.s` (for older versions of GCC)

### To Run

Use the following command:

- `./binary_search`
