## **Description**

I initially wrote this program for a homework assignment in a computer organization and Assembly language course taught by [Dr. Mahmut Unan](https://www.uab.edu/cas/computerscience/people/faculty-directory/mahmut-unan) at [UAB](https://www.uab.edu/), and then I polished it.

This program is an interactive binary search program written in AT&T `x86_64` Assembly (GNU Assembly).

## **Instructions**

### **To Compile**

Use any of the following commands:

- `make`
- `gcc -Wall -no-pie -o binary_search binary_search.s` (for GCC 9 or newer)
- `gcc -Wall -o binary_search binary_search.s` (for older versions of GCC)

### **To Run**

Use the following command:

- `./binary_search`
